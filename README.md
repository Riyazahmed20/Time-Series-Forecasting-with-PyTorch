# Time-Series-Forecasting-with-PyTorch

## Objective
This project demonstrates how to build and train a time series forecasting model using PyTorch. It is intended for learners and practitioners interested in applying deep learning techniques to sequential data.

## Description
Time series forecasting is a crucial task in many domains such as finance, weather prediction, and stock market analysis. This notebook showcases a step-by-step pipeline for modeling time series data using PyTorch, including data preparation, sequence generation, model definition using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), training, and evaluation.

### Key Highlights:
- Synthetic dataset generation for demonstration.
- Custom dataset class to handle sequence data.
- LSTM-based model architecture.
- Training loop with loss tracking.
- Visualization of predictions vs actual values.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies:
